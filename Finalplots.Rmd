## 1.Introduction
### 1.1 Abstract


### 1.2 Background


The Chesapeake Bay watershed is a vital resource, both ecologically and economically. In the region, we focus on three different types of counties - James City, Isle of Wight, and Portsmouth, as the prototype.

### 1.3 Motivation & Use Case

To build resilient communities, the HRPDC has set up a green infrastructure plan. This plan aims to to identify and prioritize a network of valuable conservation lands in order to achieve multiple benefits, such as habitat protection, drinking water supply protection, stormwater management and recreational opportunities. A new component of this plan is to build a model for the potential future growth and identify which areas of the green infrastructure network are most at risk for development.
